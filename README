== Netcap

Project status: Inactive, unfinished

Some network capture code using the ruby-pcap library!

Watches for HTTP traffic and a few other cases. It is designed to report the results to a web server that persists the data.

The file pcap_extension.rb contains my additions to the Pcap module.
